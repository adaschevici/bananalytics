This is an idea i have about writing a really lightweigth tool for monitoring traffic on the intranet.

Why: piwik - really bulky

What: twisted plugin to monitor things based on the server logs(configurable)
      No database
      No aditional configuration
      Just deploy and it should work based on the rules defined
      
Another thought, even better: Golang -> build, upload and it works
